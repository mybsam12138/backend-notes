# Tax Basics for Businesses (VAT & Corporate Income Tax)

## Overview
Businesses commonly deal with two core taxes:
- **Value-Added Tax (VAT)**: a transaction-based (indirect) tax on value added.
- **Corporate Income Tax (CIT)**: a profit-based (direct) tax on net income.

These two taxes serve different purposes and are calculated differently.

## Value-Added Tax (VAT)

### What VAT Taxes
VAT taxes the **value added** at each stage of production or service delivery.

### Key Concepts
- **Output VAT**: VAT charged on sales to customers.
- **Input VAT**: VAT paid on purchases from suppliers.
- **VAT Payable**:
  
```
  VAT Payable = Output VAT − Input VAT
  ```

### Input VAT Deduction
- Only **VAT special invoices** (or legally deductible e-invoices) generate deductible input VAT.
- Ordinary invoices usually **cannot** be used to deduct VAT.
- If input VAT exceeds output VAT, the excess can be:
  - Carried forward to future periods, or
  - Refunded (subject to conditions).

### Common Non-Deductible Items
- Employee wages and benefits
- Social insurance and housing fund
- Certain consumer services explicitly restricted by tax rules

### VAT in Practice
- VAT is usually declared **monthly or quarterly**.
- VAT is not a business cost when deductible; it is passed through to the state.

## Corporate Income Tax (CIT)

### What CIT Taxes
CIT taxes the **profit** of a company.

### Core Formula
```
Taxable Income = Revenue − Costs − Expenses − Losses
CIT Payable = Taxable Income × CIT Rate
```

### Role of Expenses
- Legitimate costs and expenses **reduce taxable income**.
- Common deductible items:
  - Payroll (wages, social security, benefits within limits)
  - Rent
  - Utilities
  - Depreciation
  - Service fees (with valid invoices)

### Key Difference from VAT
- CIT focuses on **net profit**, not transactions.
- Even expenses without deductible VAT may still reduce CIT.

## Relationship Between VAT and CIT

| Item | VAT | Corporate Income Tax |
|---|---|---|
| Tax base | Value added | Net profit |
| Deduction focus | Input VAT | Costs & expenses |
| Employee costs | Not deductible | Deductible |
| Invoices role | Tax deduction tool | Expense substantiation |

---

## Practical Takeaway
- VAT optimization focuses on **input vs output VAT management**.
- CIT optimization focuses on **cost and expense compliance**.
- The same invoice may affect VAT and CIT in **different ways**.

---

## Summary
VAT and CIT are independent tax systems:
- VAT ensures tax neutrality across the supply chain.
- CIT ensures taxation based on real profitability.
Understanding both is essential for correct accounting and system design.
