# Invoices in the Tax System

## Purpose of Invoices
Invoices are **legal tax documents** used to:
- Confirm that a transaction occurred
- Identify seller and buyer
- Support tax reporting and audit
- Substantiate revenue or expenses

---

## Types of Invoices

### VAT Special Invoice
- Displays:
  - Net amount
  - VAT rate
  - VAT amount
- Allows **input VAT deduction**
- Typically used for **B2B transactions**

### VAT Ordinary Invoice (Paper or Electronic)

## Invoices and Tax Treatment

### For Sellers
- Issued invoices confirm **taxable revenue**
- Output VAT arises from invoice issuance

### For Buyers
- Special invoices generate **input VAT**
- All valid invoices support **expense deduction** for CIT

---

## Common Misunderstandings
- Invoices are **not tax payment receipts**
- Customer invoices cannot be used to reduce seller’s tax
- Only **input invoices** affect VAT deduction

---

## Practical Summary
- Invoices are transaction evidence, not tax coupons.
- VAT deduction depends on invoice type.

---

## Final Note
Invoices form the foundation of tax compliance, auditability, and business system design.
