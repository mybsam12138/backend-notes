# Risk Factors in Insurance — Motor & Property Summary

## 1. What Is a Risk Factor?

In insurance, a **risk factor** is any attribute that affects:

- The **probability** of a loss occurring
- The **severity** (cost) of that loss

In simple terms:

> **Risk factors explain how likely something bad is to happen and how expensive it could be.**

Risk factors directly drive:
- Pricing (premium calculation)
- Underwriting decisions
- Coverage limitations and exclusions
