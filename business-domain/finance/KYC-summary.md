# KYC (Know Your Customer) — Insurance & Financial Systems Summary

## 1. What Is KYC?

**KYC (Know Your Customer)** is a mandatory regulatory process used by financial institutions to verify the **true identity** of customers before providing services.

In simple terms:

> **KYC answers one core question: Who is really participating in this financial activity?**

KYC is required across the financial industry, including:
- Banks
- Insurance companies
- Securities / stock brokers
- Payment institutions

---

## 2. Why KYC Is Required

KYC exists to prevent:

- Money laundering (AML)
- Terrorist financing
- Fraud and identity abuse
- Use of financial systems by anonymous actors

From a regulator’s perspective:

> **Any system that moves, transforms, or legitimizes money must know who is behind it.**

## 3. KYC vs Risk Assessment (Key Distinction)

| Concept | Purpose |
|------|------|
| KYC | Verify *who* the customer is |
| Risk assessment | Evaluate *how risky* the customer or activity is |

Important:
- KYC is about **identity**
- Risk factors are about **probability and severity of loss**

They serve different roles but work together.

## 4. What Information Is Collected in KYC

### 4.1 Individual Customers
- Full legal name
- National ID / passport number
- Date of birth
- Nationality
- Residential address
- ID document images

---

### 4.2 Corporate Customers
- Company registration number
- Legal representative
- Business license
- Registered address
- Ultimate beneficial owner (where required)

---

## 5. Why Insurance Systems Need KYC

Although insurance is not a bank, it can be misused to:
- Legitimize illicit funds
- Hide the real controller of money
- Enable fraud through fake identities

Insurance payouts are considered **legitimate economic compensation**, which makes insurance attractive for laundering if identity controls are weak.

Therefore, KYC is required:
- Before policy issuance (or binding)
- Before claim payment
- When beneficiaries are involved

---

## 6. What KYC Can and Cannot Do

### KYC Can:
- Bind a real identity to a policy
- Prevent anonymous participation
- Enable audit and accountability
- Support AML monitoring

### KYC Cannot:
- Directly verify the source of funds
- Replace bank-level AML checks
- Guarantee that no crime exists

KYC is **identity control**, not financial forensics.

## 7. Who Checks What (AML Responsibility Split)

| Actor | Responsibility |
|----|----|
| Bank / Payment provider | Source of funds |
| Insurance company | Identity & product usage |
| Law enforcement | Criminal investigation |

This layered approach is intentional.

---

## 8. Why KYC Makes Money “Usable”

In AML terms, money becomes “clean” when it has:
- A legitimate explanation
- A traceable identity
- Low future compliance friction

Insurance payouts backed by valid KYC:
- Are contract-based
- Are event-driven
- Are less likely to trigger downstream scrutiny

---

## 9. One-Sentence Summary (Blog-Ready)

> **KYC is a foundational regulatory control that ensures financial activities are tied to real, identifiable persons, preventing anonymous misuse of insurance and other financial systems.**

---

## 10. Key Takeaway

> **KYC does not prove money is clean — it proves someone is accountable.**

That accountability is what protects the financial system.
